## Probabilities and Conditional Probabilities

### Two-way Contingency Table

Rows represent one variable (e.g., treatment type), columns represent another variable (e.g., outcome), cells contain counts or probabilities, and margins show totals. Essential for calculating conditional probabilities.

## Derivatives and Functions

### Derivative Graph vs Original Function
